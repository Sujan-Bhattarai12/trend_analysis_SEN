### Using Multivariate Logistic Regression on Climate Data to Detect Climate Change
##### Highlights of the Findings
The Langtang region receives 57-78% of its annual total precipitation as rain and 22-43% as snow. Most precipitation as rain occurs during June, July, and August.
The rain-snow transition temperature is 1.78 °C.
The rainfall fraction shows an increasing trend annually: daytime (+0.17% per year), nighttime (+0.10% per year), and across all timestamps except during winter nights.
Significant changepoints in rainfall fraction were observed between 1990 and 2000.
##### Abstract
Studies worldwide report changes in rainfall fraction in mountain regions due to climate change, often reflecting a shift from snow to rain precipitation. However, for Nepal’s Hindu Kush Himalaya region, the trend in precipitation phase changes is not well documented. This study focuses on the Langtang region, analyzing changes in snow and rain precipitation over 40 years (1979-2018) using bias-corrected WFDEI climate reanalysis data.

Advanced statistical and physical models, including psychrometric energy models, were used to partition precipitation into rain and snow. Statistical techniques like Exponential Weighted Average, Mann-Kendall's test, Sen's slope estimator, and changepoint analysis (Pettit's method and AMOC) were employed to identify trends and changepoints.

The results reveal an increasing trend in rainfall fraction for most timestamps except winter nights, with significant changepoints between 1990 and 2000. Post-monsoon months showed the highest annual increase, while winter nights exhibited minimal change. The rain-snow transition temperature was identified as 1.78 °C.
